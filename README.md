Store and get application messages into custom categories and onto different supports.
Currently only implemented support is cookies by means of [PHPCraft.Cookie](https://github.com/vukbgit/PHPCraft.Cookie) and ultimately of [Patrick Louys Http](https://github.com/PatrickLouys/http) but sessions and maybe database are planned
Categories can be used to build messages display interface, for example using Bootstrap helper message but this class do NOT generate interface, that is view layer business (i.e. template)
